[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=postgres,py,cpp,java&perline=6)](https://skillicons.dev)

Also I'm working in JupyterLab using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

I'm interested in working as a data analyst in eSports (Dota 2). I have my own telegram channel where I share my thoughts about the game and the data about it - t.me/casualdotoo.

P.S. Currently I'm working on an app TE_Manager (Backend Java Developer), but, this is a commercial project, so I can't share my repository, but you can check the app in our site - temanager.com.
